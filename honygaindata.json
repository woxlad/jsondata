It is a free app that works on virtually any mobile or desktop device, enabling you to earn passive cashflow whilst literally barely having to lift a finger, by securely sharing your Internet connection, which is then used to gather publicly-available web data crucial for businesses seeking to improving their ad ranking, compare prices, and prevent ad fraud; all without compromising your data security. Essentially, Honeygain allows you to monetize your unused internet traffic by turning your device into a network gateway (residential proxy). While it does not promise a very bountiful yield, the little rewards gained do add a little something to the small things in life that can brighten up one‚Äôs day, like paying for a monthly Netflix subscription, or that one expensive rare treat.",
