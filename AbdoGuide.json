      "paragraph" : "A chat application makes it easy to communicate with people anywhere in the world by sending and receiving messages in real time. With a web or mobile chat app, users are able to receive the same engaging and lively interactions through custom messaging features, just as they would in person. This also keeps users conversing on your platform instead of looking elsewhere for a messaging solution. Whether it’s private chat, group chat, or large-scale chat, adding personalized chat features to your app can help ensure that your users have a memorable experience."

I personally have started to find myself using my smartphone both for business and for entertainment much more often then a PC, even if it is within my usual reach. What if I could also play my favorite PC games on Android, right here on my couch? So, that I donâ€™t need to turn my computer or gaming console on? Would my life become happier? Definitely, yes.

      "paragraph" : "If you havenâ€™t found the game you like on Google Play store, simply port it to Android on your own. Itâ€™s possible with the help of our latest Android app called ExaGear Strategies, which is a kind of an Android emulator for porting x86 Windows software to ARM-based Android hardware. The only limitation here is the game minimum system requirements. Currently, rather old and medium age games would be the best choice (titles Like Diablo 2, Heroes series, Stronghold Crusaders, Hal-Life 2 and alike). They can meet the most of Android devicesâ€™ technical limitations and can be ported without any performance loss."
